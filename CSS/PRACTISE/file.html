<h1> "STORY OF RADHAKRISHNA"</h1> 
<body>
    <p>The story of Radha and Krishna is a timeless tale of divine love, with Radha representing the soul's longing for the divine. They spent their youth in Vrindavan, where Krishna, with his enchanting flute, captured Radha's heart. Although they were deeply in love and shared many moments, Krishna eventually had to leave to fulfill his divine mission and was later married to Rukmini and Satyabhama. In their later lives, Radha sought him out in Dwarka before eventually leaving his palace to live a spiritual life in an ashram, where Krishna visited her one last time to play his flute as she passed away.

    <p>In Krishnaism, Krishna is referred to as Svayam Bhagavan[11] and Radha is illustrated as the primeval potency of the three main potencies of God, Hladini (immense spiritual bliss), Sandhini (eternality), and Samvit (existential consciousness), of which Radha is an embodiment of the feeling of love towards Krishna (Hladini).[12][13]

With Krishna, Radha is acknowledged as the Supreme Goddess.[14] Krishna is said to be satiated only by devotional service in loving servitude, personified by Radha. Various devotees worship her to attain Krishna via her. Radha is also depicted to be Krishna himself, split into two for the purpose of his enjoyment.[15] As per scriptures, Radha is considered as the complete incarnation of Mahalakshmi.[16][17]

It is believed that Krishna enchants the world, but Radha enchants even him. Therefore, she is the supreme goddess of all, and together they are called Radha-Krishna.[18] In many Vaishnava sections, Radha Krishna are often identified as the avatars of Lakshmi Narayana.[19]
